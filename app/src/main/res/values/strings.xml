    <string name="founderText2"> Graduation in Chemical Engineering in Benaras Hindu University and Management from Harvard University of U.S.A.</string>

    <string name="founderText3">Awards:</string><string name="founderText4"> In due Recognition of his contribution for the industrial sector in India, he was awarded with "PADMA SHRI" in 1977 and "PADMA BHUSHAN" in 2001 by the Govt. of India., and was awarded "DOCTORATE" by Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad. \n \nDr.B.V.Raju Served as Managing Director and Chairman of Cement Corporation of India. Founder Chairman of   Raasi Group of Industries, which included Sri Vishnu Cements Ltd., Raasi Refractories Ltd., Raasi Ceramics Ltd., and Raasi Finance and Investments Ltd. \n \nBeing an earnest scholarly man, he knew best the value of education and so he diverted his focus from industrial field to the vast field of education to set up a series of colleges under Dr. B.V. Raju Foundation and Sri Vishnu Educational Society. \n
</string>

    <string name="chairmanHeading">Mr. K.V. Vishnu Raju \n Chaiman</string>
    <string name="chairmanText">Sri. K.V. Vishnu Raju is the grandson of the Founder Chairman, Late. Padma Bhushan Dr. B.V. Raju and is his ardent follower and admirer. \n\nWith the demise of the Founder Chairman, he succeeded Dr. B.V. Raju as the Chairman of Dr. B.V. Raju Foundation and Sri Vishnu Educational Society in June 2002.</string>

    <string name="chairmanText1">Education:</string>
    <string name="chairmanText2"> He had his primary schooling in England. He continued his schooling at Ooty and then at New Delhi. He studied Class X in Little Flower School, Hyderabad and Intermediate in Little Flower Jr. College, Hyd. He completed graduation in Chemical Engineering at REC, Trichy &amp; Post Graduation at Michigan Tech University, U.S.A.</string>

    <string name="chairmanText3">Awards:</string>
    <string name="chairmanText4"> Sri K V Vishnu Raju, received the Distinguished Alumnus Award in Golden Jubilee Celebrations of NIT, Trichy for Excellence in Service to Society.\n\nHe is now the Chairman and Managing Director of Vennar Ceramics Ltd., Sai Aditya Foods &amp; Retail Pvt. Ltd. and Anjani Projects &amp; Constructions Ltd.\n\nHe was greatly influenced by his grandfather from whom he had imbibed the qualities of simplicity, hard work, will power, patience and kindliness.
        \n\nAfter the passing away of Dr. B.V. Raju, the twin responsibilities of running the college and the industries devolved on Sri Vishnu Raju\'s young shoulders. But his tenure as a veritable understudy to the Founder Chairman had helped him hone his administrative skills and acumen. He had also inherited the dynamism, diligence, stamina and the perseverance of his grandfather.\n\nHe believes that it is inactivity and not activity that wears down the body and spirit. While Sri. K.V. Vishnu Raju is the personification of equanimity and
affability, he is a tough taskmaster expecting everyone to perform to his or her potential.
